### Hi there!! 👋 😎

I am completing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology! 
I am learning to write code... I know some HTML and CSS, along with Python, C++, and Java! So...yeah! I'm trying to learn new things too!! 😄

Also, I have a YouTube channel which features tutorials related to programming as well as some videos on Python! Do check it out - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCbyP0evXOnZ4vxFEnVn9w/featured
